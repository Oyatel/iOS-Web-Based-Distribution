A simple set of PHP scripts we use to provide beta releases of our iOS application.

If you want to use these scripts you would want to do the following:

= Upload your application binaries =
Application binaries should be uploaded to the "builds" directory in order
to work out of the box

= Set required settings =
You should use the file in inc/OyatelDistribution.class.php to
define abstracted methods from inc/OyatelDistributionAbstract.class.php,
and possibly override other methods as well if you want to make some
tweaks to the setup and directories.
