A simple set of PHP scripts we use to provide beta releases of our iOS application.

If you want to use these scripts you would want to do the following:

= Upload your application binaries =
Application binaries should be uploaded to the "builds" directory in order
to work out of the box.

= Set required settings =
You should use the file in inc/OyatelDistribution.class.php to implement the required methods
that are in the stub file; this will allow you to change the application title, bundle info etc.
according to our needs.
You can also override any method from the inherited in this class.
